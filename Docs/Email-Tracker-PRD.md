# Project Requirement Document: Gmail Email Open Tracker

**Project codename:** PingPong
**Owner:** Sano
**Prepared for:** Google Antigravity build agent
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-07-05

---

## 1. Purpose & Background

Sano currently relies on a third-party Gmail tracking add-on (paid tiers gate open counts, timestamps, and open history). This project replaces that dependency with a **fully self-hosted, zero-paywall, unlimited-use email open tracker** for Gmail.

Core guarantee: every feature described here has **no usage cap, no premium tier, and no recurring cost** beyond free-tier hosting limits (which comfortably cover the target volume of under 100 tracked emails/month).

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals (v1 scope)
- Auto-insert a unique invisible tracking pixel into every email sent from Gmail's compose window, via a Chrome extension.
- Log every time that pixel is loaded (i.e. every email open) with timestamp, approximate location (from IP), and device/client info (from User-Agent).
- Support **per-recipient tracking** as an architectural capability (not required to be exposed in the UI immediately, but the data model must not block it later).
- Persist all data long-term in a real database (Postgres).
- Provide a simple two-tier web dashboard:
  - **List view:** every tracked email sent, with subject, recipient(s), send time, and total open count.
  - **Detail view:** click into any email to see every individual open event (timestamp, count number, rough location, device).
- No login/auth required — single-user, private-by-obscurity dashboard (protected only by a hard-to-guess URL/token, see Section 6.3).

### 2.2 Explicit Non-Goals (v1)
- **No click tracking** (link rewriting) — explicitly excluded from this version.
- **No multi-user support / login system** — single user only.
- **No mobile app** — web dashboard only, works fine on mobile browser regardless.
- **No email sending functionality** — this tool only tracks emails sent normally through Gmail; it does not send email itself.

### 2.3 Future headroom (not built now, but architecture shouldn't block it later)
- Per-recipient open attribution surfaced in the UI (data model supports it from day one; UI can be added later without a schema rewrite).
- Click tracking (can be added later as an additional redirect-based endpoint).
- Optional lightweight auth if the dashboard is ever exposed more publicly.

## 3. Key Architecture

### 3.1 High-level flow

```
[Gmail Compose Window]
        │
        │ (1) Chrome extension detects "Send" click
        ▼
[Chrome Extension - content script]
        │
        │ (2) Generates unique tracking ID (UUID)
        │ (3) Injects invisible 1x1 pixel <img> tag into email body,
        │     pointing to hosted pixel endpoint with tracking ID in URL
        ▼
[Email sent normally via Gmail]
        │
        │ (4) Recipient opens email → their email client requests the pixel image
        ▼
[Hosted Backend - Node.js/Express on Railway]
        │
        │ (5) Logs open event to Postgres (timestamp, IP, user-agent, tracking ID)
        │ (6) Returns a real 1x1 transparent GIF (so nothing looks broken)
        ▼
[Postgres Database - Railway managed Postgres]
        │
        │ (7) Dashboard queries this data
        ▼
[Web Dashboard - served by same Node.js backend]
        │
        └─ List view + Detail view (server-rendered or lightweight SPA)
```

### 3.2 Technology stack

| Layer | Technology | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome Extension | Manifest V3, vanilla JS (content script + minimal background service worker) | No framework needed for a small content-script injection; keeps it lightweight and easy for Antigravity to scaffold |
| Backend API | Node.js + Express | Simple, well-documented, minimal boilerplate, huge ecosystem, easy Railway deployment |
| Database | PostgreSQL (Railway managed Postgres, free tier) | Real persistence, relational structure fits emails→opens 1-to-many cleanly, free tier sufficient at this volume |
| ORM / DB access | Prisma | Type-safe queries, easy migrations, works cleanly with Antigravity-style codegen, good fit for Node+Postgres |
| Dashboard frontend | Server-rendered EJS templates **or** a minimal React SPA served from the same Express app (pick EJS for v1 simplicity — see Section 3.3) | Avoids a second deployment/hosting target; keeps everything in one Railway service |
| Hosting | Railway (single service: Express app + Postgres plugin) | No cold-start sleep issue (unlike Render free tier), usage-based free credit comfortably covers <100 emails/month, single dashboard to manage both app and DB |
| Pixel image | Static 1x1 transparent GIF served as binary buffer response | GIF (not PNG) for maximum compatibility with older email client image renderers |

### 3.3 Why EJS over React for the dashboard
Given the low complexity (a list page + a detail page, no complex client-side interactivity, no real-time updates needed), a server-rendered EJS approach avoids the overhead of a separate frontend build pipeline, a second deployment target, or CORS configuration. This keeps the entire project inside **one Railway service or a max of two Railway services (app + DB)**, and keeps the file structure Antigravity needs to generate dramatically simpler. React can be swapped in later if the dashboard grows more complex (e.g. real-time updates, filters, charts).

### 3.4 Data model (Prisma schema concept)

Two core tables, designed from day one to support per-recipient tracking even though the UI won't expose it in v1:

**`Email` table**
- `id` (UUID, primary key) — this is the tracking ID embedded in the pixel URL
- `subject` (string, optional — filled in manually or left blank if not captured)
- `recipient` (string — primary recipient email, or comma-joined list for now)
- `sentAt` (timestamp)
- `createdAt` (timestamp, auto)

**`OpenEvent` table**
- `id` (UUID, primary key)
- `emailId` (foreign key → Email.id)
- `openedAt` (timestamp, auto on insert)
- `ipAddress` (string)
- `userAgent` (string)
- `approxLocation` (string, nullable — derived from IP via free geolocation lookup)
- `recipientHint` (string, nullable — reserved for future per-recipient attribution; unused in v1 UI but present in schema)
- `confidence` (enum: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW — assigned at insert time based on User-Agent; see Phase 5.5)
- `isFiltered` (boolean, default false — true if the hit was identified as a bot, proxy, or automated tool; filtered events are excluded from all open counts)

This structure means: **confirmed open count** = count of `OpenEvent` rows where `isFiltered = false` per `emailId`. **Individual open event list** = all `OpenEvent` rows for that `emailId`, sorted by `openedAt`.

---

## 4. Scope of Work — Phased Plan

### **Phase 0: Environment & Project Setup** *(local only)*
- [x] Initialize monorepo with two top-level folders: `/extension` and `/server`.
- [x] Set up Prisma schema with `Email` and `OpenEvent` models (`schema.prisma` complete).
- [x] Set up `.env` handling for `DATABASE_URL`, `BASE_URL`, and `DASHBOARD_SECRET` (`.env.example` complete).
- [x] `docker-compose.yml` present for local Postgres instance.
- [x] `railway.json` deployment config scaffolded (used in Phase 6).
- [x] Run initial Prisma migration against local Postgres (`prisma migrate dev`).
- [x] Confirm local server starts and `GET /health` returns `{ status: 'ok' }`.

> **Strategy:** All development (Phases 0–5) is done locally against the Docker Compose Postgres. Railway deployment is deferred to **Phase 6** after the full system is verified locally.

**Deliverable:** Local Express app running on `http://localhost:3000`, connected to local Postgres via Docker Compose, with Prisma migrations applied and health check passing.

---

### **Phase 1: Backend — Pixel Tracking Endpoint**
- [x] Build `GET /pixel/:trackingId.gif` route:
  - [x] Look up or auto-create the `Email` row for `trackingId` if it doesn't exist (handles the case where the extension didn't pre-register the email).
  - [x] Insert a new `OpenEvent` row: capture IP (from request headers, accounting for proxy headers like `x-forwarded-for` since Railway sits behind a proxy), User-Agent, and timestamp.
  - [x] Perform a lightweight free IP-to-location lookup (e.g. using a free-tier geolocation API or a local IP-range dataset) to populate `approxLocation`. This must fail gracefully (log the open even if location lookup fails).
  - [x] Respond with a real 1x1 transparent GIF binary, correct `Content-Type: image/gif`, and cache-busting headers (`Cache-Control: no-store`) so repeated opens aren't silently deduplicated by client-side caching.
- [x] Build `POST /api/emails` route (optional, used by the extension to pre-register subject/recipient metadata at send time, so the dashboard has richer info than just tracking ID).

**Deliverable:** A working pixel endpoint, testable by manually visiting the URL in a browser and confirming a new `OpenEvent` row appears in the database each time.

---

### **Phase 2: Chrome Extension — Pixel Injection**
- [x] Manifest V3 extension targeting `mail.google.com`.
- [x] Content script that:
  - [x] Detects the Gmail "Send" button click event on the compose window (Gmail's DOM structure will need selector targeting — this is the trickiest part and may need adjustment if Gmail changes its markup).
  - [x] Generates a UUID client-side for the tracking ID.
  - [x] Injects a hidden `<img src="http://localhost:3000/pixel/[uuid].gif" width="1" height="1" style="display:none">` tag at the end of the email body before the send action completes. *(URL is swapped to the Railway domain in Phase 6 before go-live.)*
  - [x] Optionally calls `POST /api/emails` first to register subject line and recipient(s) captured from the compose window fields, associating them with the same UUID.
- [x] Extension popup (minimal): shows connection status to the backend, and a link/button to open the dashboard directly.

**Deliverable:** Installable unpacked Chrome extension that successfully injects a working pixel into real sent Gmail emails, confirmed by opening the sent email from a second account/device and seeing a new `OpenEvent` logged.

---

### **Phase 3: Dashboard — List View**
- [x] Route: `GET /dashboard` (protected by a simple secret token in the URL query string or a cookie set once manually — see Section 6.3; no full login system).
- [x] Query all `Email` rows, left-joined with a count of related `OpenEvent` rows, sorted by `sentAt` descending.
- [x] Render as an EJS template: simple table — Subject, Recipient, Sent At, Open Count, "View Details" link.
- [x] Basic empty-state handling (no emails tracked yet) and basic styling (doesn't need to be fancy, just clean and readable).

**Deliverable:** Working list page showing real tracked emails and their open counts, pulling live from Postgres.

---

### **Phase 4: Dashboard — Detail View**
- [x] Route: `GET /dashboard/email/:id`.
- [x] Query the specific `Email` row plus all its `OpenEvent` rows, sorted by `openedAt` ascending (or descending — chronological order, oldest or newest first, either is fine, oldest-first probably more intuitive for "read history").
- [x] Render as an EJS template: header showing subject/recipient/sent time, followed by a table/list of every open event — timestamp, approx location, device/client (parsed roughly from User-Agent, e.g. "iPhone – Mail App" or "Windows – Chrome").
- [x] Include a simple "open count over time" mini visual if feasible (a basic sparkline or just a simple ordered list is enough for v1 — doesn't need to be a full chart library integration).

**Deliverable:** Working detail page for any tracked email showing its complete open history.

---

### **Phase 5: Polish, Edge Cases & Hardening** *(local)*
- [x] Handle Gmail's "Undo Send" delay window (avoid double-injecting pixels or racing with Gmail's own send-cancel logic).
- [x] Handle image-proxy behavior from major email providers (Gmail itself proxies images through Google's own servers when the *recipient* is also on Gmail — meaning `approxLocation`/IP will reflect Google's proxy, not the recipient's real location; this is a known, unavoidable limitation of pixel tracking for Gmail-to-Gmail emails, and should be noted in the dashboard UI as a caveat rather than presented as precise data).
- [x] Deduplicate rapid repeated opens if needed (e.g. some clients "prefetch" images multiple times in quick succession — consider a short debounce window, e.g. ignore opens from the same IP within 2 seconds of a previous logged open, to avoid inflated counts from technical artifacts rather than genuine re-opens).
- [x] Basic error logging (e.g. simple console/log file, no need for a full observability stack at this scale).
- [x] Full local end-to-end test: send a real Gmail from the extension pointing at `localhost:3000`, confirm open events log correctly, confirm dashboard displays them.

**Deliverable:** Fully working system verified locally. Ready to deploy.

---

### **Phase 5.5: Open Accuracy — Bot Filtering (Option A) + Confidence Scoring (Option C)**

Added after observing that mobile notification previews, background mail-app sync, and image proxy servers were causing false-positive open events.

**Option A — Bot / Proxy Filter:**
- [x] Implement `isBot(ua)` in `userAgentParser.js` with a comprehensive blocklist of non-human UA patterns:
  - Email image proxies: `GoogleImageProxy`, Apple Privacy Relay (`Poczta`), Yahoo Mail Proxy, Microsoft Safe Links, Fastmail Proxy, Mail.ru Proxy.
  - Email security scanners: Barracuda, Proofpoint, Mimecast, Symantec/MessageLabs, Cisco IronPort, FortiMail, Sophos, Trend Micro, Check Point, SpamAssassin, rspamd, Amazon SES, Vade Secure.
  - Generic HTTP clients: curl, wget, Python requests, Go HTTP client, Java HTTP, OkHttp, Axios, node-fetch, etc.
  - Web crawlers and uptime monitors: Googlebot, Bingbot, Pingdom, UptimeRobot, StatusCake, Semrush, Ahrefs, etc.
  - Catch-all patterns: any UA string explicitly containing "bot", "crawler", "spider", "headless", "scraper", etc.
  - Empty / missing User-Agent strings (always considered automated).
- [x] Bot hits are **stored** in the database with `isFiltered = true` (preserving the audit trail) but are **never counted** as opens in the dashboard.
- [x] Geo-lookup is skipped for filtered hits (the IP belongs to the proxy/scanner, not the recipient, so the location would be meaningless).

**Option C — Confidence Scoring:**
- [x] Implement `getConfidence(ua, parsedUA)` in `userAgentParser.js`, returning HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW:
  - **HIGH**: Desktop email clients (Outlook, Thunderbird, eM Client, Postbox, Mailspring, Mimestream, Superhuman, HEY Mail, desktop Airmail/Spark) and desktop webmail browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, macOS Safari/Mail) — these clients load images only on explicit user open.
  - **MEDIUM**: Mobile clients (Gmail app, Apple Mail on iOS/iPad, Outlook for iOS/Android, Yahoo Mail mobile, mobile Safari) — susceptible to notification-preview and background-sync prefetches, so confident the pixel fired but not that a human deliberately read the message.
  - **LOW**: Any UA not matched above — unrecognised clients, unusual strings, or patterns resembling proxies that slipped the isBot() filter.
- [x] Add `OpenConfidence` enum to `schema.prisma` (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW).
- [x] Add `confidence` (enum, default LOW) and `isFiltered` (boolean, default false) fields to `OpenEvent` model.
- [x] Create and apply migration: `20260707221407_add_confidence_and_filtered`.
- [x] `pixel.js` computes and stores both fields on every `OpenEvent` insert.
- [x] Dashboard list view shows **Confirmed Opens** (non-filtered), **Bot/Proxy Hits** count, and confidence-aware Last Opened.
- [x] Dashboard detail view shows a per-event Confidence badge (✅ High / ⚠️ Medium / ❓ Low / 🤖 Filtered) and a summary chip breakdown in the hero panel.
- [x] Timeline chart excludes filtered hits so bots don't inflate the visual trend.
- [x] README and PRD updated to document the new system.

**Deliverable:** Dashboard shows accurate, human-only open counts with full audit trail of all events (including bot/proxy hits). Mobile false positives are either filtered (proxies) or flagged (mobile apps) rather than silently inflating counts.

---

### **Phase 6: Railway Deployment & Go-Live**
- [ ] Create Railway project: one Node.js service + one Postgres plugin.
- [ ] Push code to GitHub and connect the repo to Railway for auto-deploy.
- [ ] Set Railway environment variables: `DATABASE_URL` (auto-linked by Railway), `DASHBOARD_SECRET`, `BASE_URL` (set to the live Railway domain), `NODE_ENV=production`.
- [ ] Run Prisma migration against Railway Postgres: `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy`.
- [ ] Generate Railway domain and confirm `GET /health` returns `{ status: 'ok' }` on the live URL.
- [ ] Update the pixel base URL constant in `content-script.js` from `localhost:3000` to the live Railway domain.
- [ ] Reload the unpacked Chrome extension and send a real test email to confirm end-to-end tracking works on the live deployment.
- [ ] Write README with local dev setup + Railway deployment instructions.

**Deliverable:** A stable, live, publicly-reachable deployment on Railway with all known limitations clearly documented.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance
- At <100 emails/month, no meaningful load concerns. Pixel endpoint should respond in well under 200ms to avoid any visible delay in image rendering in the recipient's email client.

### 6.2 Reliability
- Pixel endpoint must **never throw a hard error that breaks the image response** — even if the database write fails, it should still attempt to return a valid transparent GIF (fail silently on logging, never fail visibly to the recipient).

### 6.3 Security & Privacy
- No formal login system (per requirements), but the `/dashboard` routes should be protected by a simple shared-secret token (e.g. `?key=your-long-random-token` checked against an environment variable) so the dashboard isn't fully public to anyone who guesses the Railway URL.
- IP addresses and location data are personally identifiable to some degree — store them, but don't expose them anywhere beyond the private dashboard.
- No third-party analytics or external calls beyond the free IP-geolocation lookup service.

### 6.4 Known Limitations (to document clearly, not hide)
- Gmail-to-Gmail opens: Google's `GoogleImageProxy` is definitively filtered out (not counted). For Gmail users who open via webmail (Chrome/Firefox), the pixel fires normally and is counted with real confidence scoring.
- Apple Mail Privacy Protection (MPP): Apple's Privacy Relay UA is detected and filtered out. Direct iOS/macOS Apple Mail opens are counted (iOS at Medium confidence due to notification-preview risk; macOS at High confidence).
- Corporate email security scanners (Barracuda, Proofpoint, Mimecast, etc.) are detected by UA string and filtered out.
- Mobile notification previews and background sync: these cannot be distinguished from genuine opens at the pixel level (same UA, same IP). They are classified as Medium confidence so the user understands there is uncertainty, but they cannot be definitively excluded without a two-stage confirmation mechanism (Option D — not implemented in this version).
- Some email clients block remote images by default until the user clicks "show images" — meaning "opened" technically means "opened and loaded remote images," which is the same caveat every commercial email tracker has.

---

## 7. Success Criteria (v1 "Done" definition)
- [ ] Chrome extension successfully injects a tracking pixel into every Gmail email sent, without breaking normal Gmail send functionality.
- [ ] Every genuine open (barring the documented client-side limitations above) is logged with timestamp, approximate location, and device info.
- [ ] Dashboard list view shows all tracked emails with accurate open counts.
- [ ] Dashboard detail view shows the complete chronological open history for any selected email.
- [ ] Entire system runs on Railway's free tier at the target volume (<100 emails/month) with no unexpected costs.
- [ ] No feature in this document is gated behind any paywall, tier, or subscription — full functionality, always free.

---

## 8. Notes for the Build Agent (Google Antigravity)
- Prioritize Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 in strict order — the pixel endpoint must exist and be tested *before* wiring up the extension, since the extension has nothing to point to otherwise.
- Phase 4's "device/client parsing" from User-Agent strings doesn't need a heavy library — a small set of regex checks for common patterns (iPhone Mail, Outlook, Gmail app, Chrome desktop, etc.) is sufficient; falling back to "Unknown device" is fine for anything unrecognized.
- Keep the Chrome extension's Gmail DOM selectors isolated in one clearly-commented section of `content-script.js`, since Gmail's front-end markup changes periodically and this will likely need future maintenance independent of the rest of the system.

---

## 9. Post-Development Setup & Usage Guide

This section covers everything needed **after** Antigravity finishes building the project — from account creation to actually tracking your first real email. Written for a first-time Railway signup, single Gmail account, and assumes comfort with Chrome's unpacked extension loading.

### 9.1 One-time account & hosting setup

**Step 1 — Create a Railway account**
1. Go to `railway.app` and sign up (GitHub login is the fastest option, since you'll likely want to push this project's code to a GitHub repo anyway for Railway to deploy from).
2. Verify your email if prompted.
3. Railway will ask for a payment method to unlock the usage-based free tier eventually, but at your volume (<100 emails/month) you should stay within the free monthly credit indefinitely. You can skip adding a card initially — Railway allows a trial period without one — and only add it if/when prompted.

**Step 2 — Push the generated project to GitHub**
1. Once Antigravity finishes generating the `server/` folder, initialize a git repo inside it (if not already done): `git init`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "initial commit"`.
2. Create a new empty repository on GitHub (e.g. `mailping-server`).
3. Push: `git remote add origin [your-repo-url]`, then `git push -u origin main`.
4. Keep the `extension/` folder in the same repo or a separate one — either works, since it's never deployed to Railway (it only runs locally in Chrome).

**Step 3 — Create the Railway project**
1. In the Railway dashboard, click **New Project → Deploy from GitHub repo**, and select your `mailping-server` repo.
2. Railway will auto-detect it's a Node.js app and attempt a build. If it needs a start command, set it explicitly in Railway's service settings to `node src/index.js` (or whatever your actual entry file is called).
3. Add a **Postgres database**: in the same Railway project, click **New → Database → Add PostgreSQL**. Railway automatically creates a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and makes it available to your app service.

**Step 4 — Set environment variables**
In your Railway app service's **Variables** tab, add:
- `DATABASE_URL` — Railway usually auto-links this from the Postgres plugin; confirm it's present.
- `DASHBOARD_SECRET` — make up a long random string yourself (e.g. generate one at `randomkeygen.com` or just mash your keyboard for 40+ characters). This is the token that protects your `/dashboard` route.
- Any geolocation API key, if the IP-lookup service Antigravity chose requires one (some free-tier geo APIs work keyless; check what was actually implemented).

**Step 5 — Run the database migration**
1. Railway gives you a way to run one-off commands against your deployed service (via the **Railway CLI**, or a "Run command" option in the dashboard).
2. Install the Railway CLI locally if you don't have it: `npm install -g @railway/cli`, then `railway login`.
3. Link your local project folder to the Railway project: `railway link`.
4. Run the Prisma migration against the live database: `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy`.
5. Confirm it succeeded — Railway's Postgres plugin has a built-in data browser where you should now see empty `Email` and `OpenEvent` tables.

**Step 6 — Get your live app URL**
1. In the Railway app service, go to **Settings → Networking** and click **Generate Domain**. Railway gives you a free `*.up.railway.app` URL.
2. Test it: visit `https://[your-app].up.railway.app/pixel/test123.gif` in your browser. You should see a tiny blank image load with no errors, and a new row should appear in your `OpenEvent` table for tracking ID `test123`.
3. **Save this URL** — you'll need it in the next step for the Chrome extension.

### 9.2 Installing the Chrome extension

Since you're already comfortable with unpacked extensions, the short version:

1. In `extension/`, open `content-script.js` and update the base pixel URL constant to point to your real Railway domain from Step 6 above (e.g. `https://mailping-production.up.railway.app`).
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked**, and select the `extension/` folder.
4. Confirm the extension icon appears in your Chrome toolbar and shows "Connected" (or equivalent status) when you click it — this confirms it can reach your Railway backend.
5. Pin the extension icon for easy access if you want a visual reminder it's active.

**Note:** unpacked extensions reset if Chrome updates in certain ways or if you ever remove/re-add the folder — if it ever disappears from your toolbar, just repeat step 3 pointing at the same folder.

### 9.3 Sending your first tracked email

1. Open Gmail, click **Compose**.
2. Write your email normally — subject, recipient, body — exactly as you always would.
3. Click **Send**.
4. Behind the scenes, the extension will have already injected the invisible pixel into the email body before it left your outbox — you won't see or notice anything different in the compose window.
5. **Important first-run sanity check:** since Gmail's "Undo Send" feature delays actual delivery by a few seconds, don't worry if the pixel doesn't register instantly — it only starts counting opens once the recipient's client actually loads the email.

### 9.4 Checking if/when it was opened

1. Go to `https://[your-app].up.railway.app/dashboard?key=[your-DASHBOARD_SECRET-value]` — bookmark this exact URL (with your secret key included) so you don't have to retype it each time.
2. You'll see the list view: every tracked email, recipient, sent time, and current open count.
3. Click into any email to see the full detail view — every individual open event, with timestamp, approximate location, and device/client info.
4. Refresh the page any time to see updated counts — there's no auto-refresh/live-updating in v1, so you'll need to manually reload if you're watching for a fresh open in real time.

### 9.5 Ongoing usage — what you do and don't need to repeat

**You do NOT need to repeat, ever again (after initial setup):**
- Railway account creation, project setup, environment variables, database migration — all one-time.
- Chrome extension loading — stays active across Gmail sessions and browser restarts, as long as you don't manually remove it from `chrome://extensions`.

**You DO need to do, every time you want to check something:**
- Just revisit your bookmarked dashboard URL — that's it. No re-login, no re-setup.

**You might occasionally need to:**
- Re-generate the Railway domain if it ever changes (rare, but if it does, update the URL constant in `content-script.js` and reload the unpacked extension).
- Re-run `railway run npx prisma migrate deploy` only if you (or Antigravity, in a future update) change the database schema later.
- Keep an eye on Railway's usage dashboard occasionally just to confirm you're staying within free credit — at <100 emails/month this should never realistically become a concern, but it costs nothing to glance at it monthly.

### 9.6 Quick troubleshooting reference

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Extension shows "disconnected" | Railway app URL in `content-script.js` doesn't match your actual deployed domain, or the Railway service is down/sleeping (shouldn't happen on Railway, unlike Render) |
| Dashboard shows emails but 0 opens, even after you confirmed the recipient opened it | Recipient's email client blocked remote images by default (common — Gmail itself sometimes does this until "Display images below" is clicked); this is a known limitation, not a bug |
| Every open shows the same generic location (e.g. "Mountain View, CA") | This is Google's own image-proxy server if the recipient is also on Gmail — expected behavior, documented in Section 6.4 of this PRD |
| Dashboard URL says "unauthorized" or similar | You forgot the `?key=[your-DASHBOARD_SECRET-value]` in the URL, or it doesn't match the Railway environment variable exactly |
